Problem Statement
==========================================================================================
`Title:` Movie Ticket Booking Management System

`Objective:`  
Develop a menu-driven C++ program 
to manage a movie ticket booking system. 
The system should maintain data for movie ticket bookings, 
including ticket amounts, food amounts, and booking IDs. 
It should support CRUD operations 
to create, read, update, and delete booking records.

---

`Requirements:`  
The program should fulfill the following requirements:

1. `Data Storage:`  
   - Maintain three arrays in the `main` function:
     - `booking_ids[]` to store unique booking IDs.
     - `ticket_amounts[]` to store ticket amounts for each booking.
     - `food_amounts[]` to store food amounts for each booking.
   - Maintain an integer variable to track the total number of bookings.

2. `Operations:`  
   Implement the following operations as menu options:
   
   - `Create Booking:`
     - Add a new booking by accepting inputs for booking ID, ticket amount, and food amount.
     - Store the data in the respective arrays and increment the number of bookings.
     - Ensure that the maximum limit of bookings is not exceeded.
   
   - `Read/Display Bookings:`
     - Display all existing bookings in a formatted tabular format, showing:
       - Booking ID
       - Ticket Amount
       - Food Amount
     - If no bookings exist, display an appropriate message.

   - `Edit Booking by ID:`
     - Allow the user to search for a booking by its ID.
     - If the booking exists, display its details and allow the user to update the ticket amount and food amount.
     - If the booking does not exist, display an appropriate message.

   - `Delete Booking by ID:`
     - Allow the user to search for a booking by its ID.
     - If the booking exists, delete it by shifting all subsequent records to fill the gap and decrement the total number of bookings.
     - If the booking does not exist, display an appropriate message.

3. `Menu Navigation:`  
   - Present a menu with options to perform the above operations.
   - Allow the user to perform multiple operations in a session until they choose to exit.

4. `Error Handling:`  
   - Handle cases where the arrays are full during the creation of a booking.
   - Handle invalid booking IDs during edit or delete operations.

---

`Example Input and Output:`  
1. `Menu Options:`  
   ```
   1. Create Booking
   2. Display All Bookings
   3. Edit Booking
   4. Delete Booking
   5. Exit
   ```

2. `Sample Output for Displaying Bookings:`  
   ```
   ------------------------------------------------
   | Booking ID | Ticket Amount | Food Amount    |
   ------------------------------------------------
   | 101        | 250           | 150            |
   | 102        | 300           | 200            |
   ------------------------------------------------
   ```

3. `Sample Operation:`  
   `Edit Booking by ID:`  
   - Input: Booking ID = 101  
   - Output:  
     ```
     Current Details:
     Booking ID: 101, Ticket Amount: 250, Food Amount: 150
     Enter New Ticket Amount: 280
     Enter New Food Amount: 180
     Booking updated successfully!
     ```

---

`Constraints:`  
- Maximum number of bookings: 100.
- Booking IDs must be unique.

---

`Implementation Guidelines:`  
- Use appropriate functions for each operation 
(e.g., `createBooking`, `editBooking`, `displayBookings`, `deleteBooking`).
- Ensure modularity and clarity in the code for easy maintenance.
- Display messages for successful operations or any encountered errors.
- Follow coding standards.

- Here all the learning objectives on "programming fundamentals" 
to be used properly. You can add your own functionality as menus to 
meet the learning outcomes.
